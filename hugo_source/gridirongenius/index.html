<p>How to build a dynasty in the NFL</p>
</section><section>
<h2 id="bill-walsh">Bill Walsh</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Champions behave like champions before they’re champions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obsessed with perfection - pushed everyone in orgnaization to LEARN more</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Counter groupthink in the NFL by building a better culture</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="standard-of-performance">Standard of Performance</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Walsh&rsquo;s version based off the Standard of Excellence book (In Search of Excellence by Peters and Waterman)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promote internal communication that is open <em>and</em> substantive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be deeply commited to learning and teaching, be fair</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Honor the direct connection between details and improvement, relentlessly seek improvement</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="culture">Culture</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Peter Drucker said culture can eat strategy for lunch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manage the culture, wins would take care of themselves</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can&rsquo;t cookup success unless you have the right culture</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="scoutingplayers-development">Scouting/Players Development</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>See players not as a collection of data and stats, but in <strong>context</strong> of schemes they run</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s lazy to grade a player without understaning the player&rsquo;s role</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scout inside out, not outside in - analysis is informed by detailed understanding of each position defined by the scheme</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="walsh-on-hiring">Walsh on hiring</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Seek intelligence, not necessarily experience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Too much experience means you might not be able to clear your head of old ideas to make room for new ideas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dee Hock said the problem is never how to get new, innovative thoughts into your mind; but how to get old ones out</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="qualities-of-a-leader">Qualities of a Leader</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Command - the room, the message, and one&rsquo;s self</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sophocles said all men make mistakes, but a good man yields when he knows his course is wrong and repairs the evil. The only crime is pride</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ultimate sign of strength is personal accountability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Share credit and blame alike</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="command-of-opportunity-and-process">Command of opportunity and process</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bob Seger told Glenn Frey - to make it in this business, he would have to write his own songs. Frey asked, but what if they&rsquo;re bad?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seger told him - of course, they&rsquo;re bad. Just keep writing until they&rsquo;re good</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Same is true as a coach, you learn on the fly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When rules don&rsquo;t apply to everyone, it causes chaos</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="al-davis-scouting">Al Davis: Scouting</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Our job is to find talent, not dismiss it - be professional</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Background of a draft pick is valuable - Al Davis loved good high school players because what if their collegiate production was squandered by poor coaching or a mismatch in talent/scheme</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="more-al-davis-scouting">More Al Davis: Scouting</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Focus on the level of competition - huge variation of talent in college—from program to program and conference to conference—and how not being able to compare apples to apples impacts draft evaluations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Davis was drawn to players who were at their best against the best</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="evaluating-talent">Evaluating talent</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Confirmation bias: eager to see what we want</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember to never begin with the end in mind</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get caught up in groupthink</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can&rsquo;t bullshit an NFL lockeroom - players know who is good and bad, who the favorites are</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best teams force players to prove their value</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="character-assessment">Character assessment</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Assessing character is a challenge: too many vairables</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sliding scale of what is right and wrong</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Character can only be assessed face-to-face</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="belichiks-secrets">Belichik&rsquo;s secrets</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Performs an autopsy after every season - clean slate for all, no one is grandfathered in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to tweak how we teach - take the lesson from the meeting room to the classroom to the field</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connect emotionally on the field, but also be objective in GM decisions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone can have an opinion as long as there is data, insight, or experience to support it</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="team-building">Team building</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Every team has a list, but Belichik&rsquo;s is a living/changeable document</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Needs change as injuries happen and skill increases, can&rsquo;t ignore that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contentment is the enemy</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="all-in-mentality">All-in mentality</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Special teams are the heart and soul of a team</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Herb Brooks, USA Hockey - gave all the players a test, goalie Jim Craig refused to take the test</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before Olympics, Brooks told Craig he might bench him and Craig though it was because he wouldn&rsquo;t take the test</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brooks said - no, it&rsquo;s because I want the guy back that wouldn&rsquo;t take the test - the fire/motivation</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="quarterback-play">Quarterback play</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Walsh belives the feet were more important than the arm</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quick feet, quick arm. Balanced feet, balanced arm. Coordinated feet, coordinated attack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Timing was everything - spacing and rhythm, it was synchronized</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offense was about preserving the lead than establishing it</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="quarterback-qualities">Quarterback qualities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Winning (and losing) are habits - Parcells&rsquo; golden rule was a QB that had at 23 wins in college</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yards per attempt - shows what a quarterback is seeing and where he&rsquo;s looking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thick skin - how do you react when something doesn&rsquo;t go your way?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Football smarts - study and work, but also how fast can you process information</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="defensive-principles">Defensive Principles</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Belichik is not much for change, but believes in adaptation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disguise is as important as defense - base that tweaks play to play based on strengths/weaknesses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New plays don&rsquo;t win consistently, but using old plays in new ways does</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="more-defensive-principles">More Defensive Principles</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Learn how an offense works: how, when, where, and why every player on the field moved during every play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Details over everything - inches in an offensive lineman&rsquo;s split stance are important</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teach defense, don&rsquo;t just coach it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make the offense play left-handed - take offense out of their comfort zones by preventing them from doing what they do best</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="remember-newtons-second-law">Remember Newton&rsquo;s Second Law</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Belichik likes speed: wants his team doing, not wondering what to do, reacting, not thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hates mistakes, but if they happen it&rsquo;s because his team is going fast and doing, not slow and confused</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pressue first, sacks second - be strategic, save certain pressure for the second half</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="four-point-plays">Four-point plays</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>3rd downs in the red zone are four-point plays - difference between a touchdown and field goal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Force teams to take small, harmless gains - this bring impatience and gets them to make a mistake</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="middle-eight">Middle Eight</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Final four minutes of first half and first four minutes of second half</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep offense off the field by controlling the back at end of first half and getting the ball to start the second</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This means you get more possessions or chances to win</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="talking-is-winning">Talking is Winning</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Talking is winning, especially on defense</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Belichik removed numbers on players jerseys in practice because he wanted them to talk more during plays</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="playoff-gameplanning">Playoff gameplanning</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Experience is not preparation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having previously played in a playoff game means nothing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Belichick&rsquo;s guide (1) what his team does well (2) what it doesn’t do well (3) what he thinks it will take to win the playoffs in a particular year</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="hidden-yards">Hidden yards</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yards that don&rsquo;t show up in stat sheet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Example: a gunner on the punt team fighting through three blocks to down the ball at the 1 instead of letting it bounce into the end zone for a touchback. It won’t show up on the stat sheet, but that guy just saved the Ravens 19 yards in a game that will be determined by inches.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="opportunity-period">Opportunity period</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Giving practice reps to backups because it might happen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Colts didn&rsquo;t believe that - Peyton Manning took all the reps - we don’t practice fucked, bad idea</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow players to be ready</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="thinking-ahead">Thinking ahead</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You&rsquo;re playing against the clock too: each play takes six seconds, 54 seconds = 9 plays</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maximize the number of yards you can get, don&rsquo;t check down</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>World class pool players make a shot and where they leave the cue ball matters almost as much as pocketing the ball</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Missed field goals are turnovers because after a miss, you lose possession and yards</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="noticing-coverages-and-matchups">Noticing coverages and matchups</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All a QB cares about is the middle of the field open or closed?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check where safeties are - open or back, means middle of field is vulnerable - closed or forward, means ball likely going to sidelines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a wideout is in motion and someone follows him, it&rsquo;s man-to-man coverage - if not, it&rsquo;s zone coverage</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="born-to-run-theory">Born to run theory</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Key to success is repetition, 10,000 hours of practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But that gets boring - don&rsquo;t get bored, Springsteen plays Born to Run a lot</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best remedy for boredom is reading and research</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="quotes">Quotes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To live in the past is to die in the present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>J. Roscoe Miller said: I have two kinds of problems: the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important and the important are never urgent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Walsh on three F’s of decision making: firmness, fairness, fast.</p>
</li>
</ul>
