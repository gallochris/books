<h2 id="by-annie-duke">By Annie Duke</h2>
<p>Making smarter decisions when you don&rsquo;t have all the facts</p>
</section><section>
<h2 id="poker-not-chess">Poker not chess</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Life is more like poker, skill and luck</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chess is all skill.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="resulting">Resulting</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A good decision does not mean a good outcome and a bad decision does not mean bad a outcome</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run a red light and be fine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go on green and get in accident.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="dr-strangelove">Dr. Strangelove</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Game theory: making decision under conditions of uncertainty overtime</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The world doesn’t easily reveal the objective truth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uncertainty can work a lot of mischief.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="process">Process</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What makes a good decision is a good process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A process that accurately represents our current state of knowledge, which is always some variance of I don’t know</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More experience just means you can make a better guess</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="reality">Reality</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We don’t perceive the world objectively, but our goal should be to try</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get comfortable about not being sure and saying I don’t know</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A loss feels twice as bad as a win feels good</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="all-decisions-are-bets">All decisions are bets</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Buying a house, parenting, choose steak over chicken, going to the movies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can only make our best guess, given what we know and what we don’t know, at what the future will look like</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="alter-beliefs">Alter beliefs</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Instead of alternating our beliefs to fit new information, we do the opposite, altering our interpretation of that information to fit our beliefs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our preexisting beliefs influence the way we experience the world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those beliefs are formed in not an orderly way, which means mischief is in our decision making</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="opposite">Opposite</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The better you are with numbers, the better you are spinning those numbers to conform and support your beliefs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We bet on our beliefs, but don’t vet those beliefs well before we form them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We stubbornly refuse to update our beliefs. And being smart doesn’t help, it makes it <em>worse</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="why-be-objective">Why be Objective?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Because the more objective we are, the more accurate our beliefs become</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Almost nothing is black and white, 0 or 100, and that’s pretty good philosophy for living</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="how-not-what">How not What</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Better served as communicators and decision-makers if we thought less about whether we are confident in our beliefs and more about <strong>how confident</strong> we are in those beliefs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This way our expression of confidence would capture all the shades of grey in-between</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s a spectrum, 76% to 63% is much better than right or wrong.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="uncertainty">Uncertainty</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Acknowledging uncertainty is the first step in measuring and narrowing it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any decision is a bet on what will likely create the most favorable future for us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes things happen because of the other form of uncertainty - LUCK</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The way things turn out could be the result of our decisions, luck, or a combination of the two</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quote: We must believe in luck, for how else can we explain the success of those we don’t like</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Golden rule of habit change - keep the old cue, deliver the old reward, but insert a new routine</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="strive-for-this">Strive for this</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be a better credit-giver than your peers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be more willing than others to admit mistakes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be more willing to explore reasons for an outcome with an open mind</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And even, and especially, if that might cast you in a bad light or shine a good light on someone else</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="what-to-ask">What to ask</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Why might my belief not be true?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What other evidence might be out there bearing on my belief?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there similar areas I can look toward to gauge whether similar beliefs to mine are true?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="more-s-to-ask">More ?s to ask</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What sources of information could I have missed or minimized on the way to reaching my belief?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the reasons someone else could have a different belief, what’s their support, and why might they be right instead of me?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What other perspectives are there as to why things turned out the way they did?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="dont-be-a-outcome-junkie">Don&rsquo;t be a outcome junkie</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You’re going to lose a lot, and win a lot</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can always, however, try to make a good bet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn how to navigate the uncertain future because you’ll never be sure of the future</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="cudos">CUDOS</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Principles for a good trust group</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communism: be a data sharer, more data you share leads to better assessment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rashomon effect: two accounts of same event, but versions are dramatically different because they’re informed by different facts and perspectives</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="cudos-continued">CUDOS continued</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can’t assume your version of the story is accurate or complete</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Universalism: don’t shoot the message, imagine if same info came from person you didn’t like</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both of these are bad: - negative opinion about person delivering message, we close our mind - positive opinion about person delivering message, we accept without vetting it</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="listen-to-the-other-side">Listen to the other side</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Listen to the other side to look for things you agree with, when we do this, we learn things we otherwise wouldn’t have learned</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only way to gain knowledge and approach truth is by examining every variety of opinion</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="cudos-continued-1">CUDOS continued</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Disinterestedness: telling someone how a story ends encourages them to be resulters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We don’t process information independent of the way we wish the world to be</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the group is blind to the outcome, it produces higher fidelity evaluation of decision quality</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="cudos-continued-2">CUDOS continued</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Organized skepticism: discussion among the group to encourage engagement and dissent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lean over backwards to figure out where we could be wrong</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Skepticism is about asking why things might <em>not be true</em> rather than why they <em>are true</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="communication-with-a-trust-group">Communication with a trust group</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Express uncertainty: listen for things you agree with, state those and be specific, follow with and instead of but</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>and</strong> is an offer to contribute</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>but</strong> is a denial and repudiation of what came before</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try using <strong>yes and</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="decision-making-help">Decision making help</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ask do you want to let it all out or are you thinking about what to do next?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focus on the future: we can identify the goals, our problem is the execution</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="the-past">The past</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rehashing our past can create defensiveness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s hard to be defensive about something that hasn’t happened yet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have you thought about how you would get rid of all this drama in the future?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<ul>
<li>Example: child with bad test scores - it must be hard to have a teacher like that, do you think there is anything you can do to improve your grade in the future?</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="consequences">Consequences</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Consequences take awhile to show: what does the intern possibly know?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It could take years for that intern to become a successful competitor before that mistake becomes obvious</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improving decision quality is about increasing our chances of good outcomes, not guaranteeing them</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="in-the-moment">In the moment</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When we make in-the-moment decisions, and don’t ponder our past or future, we are more likely to be irrational and impulsive
thinking about the future is remembering the future</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Temporal discounting - favor our present self at the expense of our future self</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="regret">Regret</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Move regret in front of our decisions: have a loss agreement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regret decision of losing lots of chips before you bought more</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="think-like-this">Think like this</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Imagine how future-you is likely to feel about the decision or imagine how you feel today if past-you made the decision
how would you feel if you made the decision 10 minutes ago? 10 months ago? 10 years ago?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This does two things:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 - influences us to make a better decision</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 - helps us treat ourselves more compassionately</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="how-we-got-there">How we got there</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It doesn’t so much matter where we end up as how we got there</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our feelings are not a reaction to the average of how things are going</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is tilt? If you blow some recent event out of proportion and react in a drastic way, you’re on tilt</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="long-view">Long view</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Long view thinking is more rational thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ulysses contract: past-us preventing present-us from doing something stupid</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Examples: take a ride share when going to a bar, automatic allocation into retirement fund</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="what-is-wrong">What is wrong?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Wrong is a conclusion, not a rationale</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we’re going to be self-critical, the focus should be on the lesson and how to calibrate future decisions</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="benefits-of-scouting-the-future">Benefits of scouting the future</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1st: scenario planning reminds us that the future is inherently uncertain, more realistic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2nd: we are better prepared for how we are going to respond to different outcomes that might result from our initial decision, anticipate positive or negative developments instead of being reactive</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="more-benefits-of-scouting-the-future">More Benefits of scouting the future</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>3rd: being able to respond to the changing future is a good thing, being surprised by the changing future is not</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4th: less likely to fall for hindsight or resulting bias</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="expected-value-example">Expected value: Example</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>$100,000 grant has 25% chance of winning (expected value is $100k * .25 = $25,000)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$200,000 grant has 10% chance of winning (expected value is $20,000)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$50,000 grant has 70% chance of winning (expected value is $35,000)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This shows that the $50,000 grant is more valuable than the $100,000 and $200,000 grants</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="backcasting">Backcasting</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When we forecast the future, the present and the immediate future look large, anything beyond that loses focus</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prospective hindsight, imagining that an event has already occurred, increases the ability to correctly identify reasons for future outcomes by 30%</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="premortem">Premortem</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Premortem: imagine a negative outcome</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backcasting is cheerleader, premortem is the heckler in the audience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incorporating negative visualization makes us more likely to achieve our goals</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="negative-visualization">Negative visualization</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We&rsquo;re more likely to execute goals if we think about negative futures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because it helps us anticipate potential obstacles and improve our likelihood of succeeding</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="tree-metaphor">Tree metaphor</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The trunk of the tree is the past</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Branches are potential futures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a potential future doesn’t happen, don’t chop it down (give the chainsaw a rest)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2 id="outcomes-and-hindsight">Outcomes and Hindsight</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When you look into the past and only see what happened, it seems inevitable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hindsight bias is the enemy of probabilistic thinking</p>
</li>
</ul>
