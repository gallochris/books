<h1 id="scorecasting">Scorecasting</h1>

<h2 id="by-tobias-j-moskowitz-and-l-jon-wertheim">By Tobias J. Moskowitz and L. Jon Wertheim</h2>

<p>Hidden influences on how sports are played and won</p>

</section><section>

<h2 id="whistle-swallowing">Whistle Swallowing</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>All about officials and omission bias with loss aversion</p></li>

<li><p>Uses Mike Carey and David Tyree catch as fundamental example.</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="acts-of-omission">Acts of Omission</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The absence of an act - as far less harmful than acts of commission - actually committing the act, even if the outcomes are the same or worse</p></li>

<li><p>Food example - declining healthy food is a poor choice (omission), but eating junk food is worse (commission)</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="omission-or-comission">Omission or Comission</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Jeff Bezos quote - “people overfocus on errors of commission, failure’s not that expensive, the big cost you incur is harder to notice, errors of omission.”</p></li>

<li><p>Officials or refs, when the game steps up, you step down</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="subjective-calls">Subjective calls</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Swallow the whistle with judgement calls versus subjective calls when the game is about to end</p></li>

<li><p>Subjective in football - holding, illegal blocks, illegal contact, and unnecessary roughness don’t happen as often when game is on the line or at its end</p></li>

<li><p>Objective calls - delay of game, illegal formation, motion, or shift are called at the same rate</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="go-for-it">Go for it</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Kevin Kelley always going for it on 4th down and never punting</p></li>

<li><p>He plays the odds and he also has job security and freedom to do so</p></li>

<li><p>All about risk aversion</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="losing-hurts">Losing hurts</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Sparky Anderson - losing hurts twice as bad as winning feels good.</p></li>

<li><p>Would you rather want a $5 discount or avoid a $5 surcharge?</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="why-take-risks">Why take risks</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>You’re more likely to risk something when you expect to lose</p></li>

<li><p>Job security is huge. Are you allowed to fail or be unconventional?</p></li>

<li><p>Belichick was not as aggressive until he won a Super Bowl. It built equity for him to take risks, fail, and not lose his job</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="larussa-example">LaRussa example</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Players must buy in too.</p></li>

<li><p>Tony LaRussa tried using pitchers for 3 innings apiece, but players didn’t like it. They wanted wins (throw for 5 innings), because it drives their contracts</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="westhead-example">Westhead example</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Paul Westhead&rsquo;s playing style at Lakers, didn’t work</p></li>

<li><p>It worked at Loyola Marymount, but failed spectacularly with Denver Nuggets</p></li>

<li><p>Players buy in matters.</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="tiger-woods-is-human">Tiger Woods is human</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>More about loss aversion, it’s a principle we dislike losing a dollar more than we enjoy earning a dollar</p></li>

<li><p>PGA tour, measured putts from identical distance for birdies and pars, putts for par were far more successful</p></li>

<li><p>Players were so concerned with a loss, you’re more aggressive in avoiding bogey than scoring birdie</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="birdie-putts">Birdie putts</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Tendency to leave putts short for birdie, being too conservative.</p></li>

<li><p>Woods even says the psychological difference between making a birdie and dropping a shot is huge, more important to make a par putt. He’s human</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="gain-and-loss">Gain and loss</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>In the face of gain, we’re conservative</p></li>

<li><p>In the face of loss, we’re aggressive.</p></li>

<li><p>It’s hard to block out how you got in a predicament. Remain even keel</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="endowment-effect">Endowment effect</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Feel the loss of something you own much more deeply than the loss of something you don’t own</p></li>

<li><p>When you own, you&rsquo;re invested emotionally in a thing versus not tied to it</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="offense-wins-championships">Offense wins Championships</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Defense is no more important than offense, both are equally important</p></li>

<li><p>Defense requires effort, it’s less glorified, harder to measure, and dark (hidden)</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="value-of-a-blocked-shot">Value of a blocked shot</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The value of blocked shots is in the details.</p></li>

<li><p>Blocked shot back to opponent was assigned a value</p></li>

<li><p>Blocked shot out of bounds was slightly more valuable</p></li>

<li><p>Blocked ball to a teammate was worth the most</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="value-of-the-act">Value of the act</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>It’s the value of the act, not the act itself that matters</p></li>

<li><p>Counting is easy, measuring value is hard</p></li>

<li><p>Tim Duncan’s 149 blocks were more valuable than Dwight Howard’s 232 blocks</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="rounding-first">Rounding first</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>People have a bias to round numbers</p></li>

<li><p>It’s why more batters hit .300 than .299.</p></li>

<li><p>A batter is close to .300 at end of season? He won’t play.</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="incentive-bias">Incentive bias</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>A rounder number (100 RBI, .300) usually leads to better salary</p></li>

<li><p>Bobby Abreu finished with exactly 20 or 30 home runs five times, seven times exactly 100 or 100 RBI, and no seasons with 95 to 99 RBI</p></li>

<li><p>Same true in NFL with 1,000 rushers</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="where-to-find-value">Where to find value?</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>You can find value in looking at players just below these round number benchmarks</p></li>

<li><p>Just below .300 or below 1,000 rushers</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="rooney-rule">Rooney Rule</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The drop-off of African American coaches winning is actually a good thing</p></li>

<li><p>Why? It validates the Rooney rule</p></li>

<li><p>Black coaches are held to same standard as white counterparts. They’re equal</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="comforts-of-home">Comforts of Home</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>There is a home-field advantage in all sports</p></li>

<li><p>It’s a bit more strong in some sports, but it’s the same regardless of where sport is played</p></li>

<li><p>There is significant incentive to win at home - concessions, people leave happy, spend more money</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="why-does-home-field-advantage-exist">Why does home field advantage exist?</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Because of crowd support? No. Look at kicks in football, free throws, shootouts - when you control for a situation where crowd could impact game, it really doesn’t</p></li>

<li><p>Because of travel? No, evidence isn’t strong that travel plays a major role.</p></li>

<li><p>Because of scheduling? Yes.</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="scheduling">Scheduling</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>NBA teams play lots of back-to-back games, and this does favor the home team</p></li>

<li><p>It’s less of an issue in certain sports like MLB</p></li>

<li><p>More extreme in college football. Teams pad schedule with hosting weak opponents</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="home-field-advantages">Home field advantages</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Scheduling bias explains some of home field advantage, but not in baseball or NFL or soccer at all</p></li>

<li><p>Because of unique home characteristics? Not really, some impact, but not huge difference. Hard to really have an edge with unique home fields today</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="officials-drive-home-advantage">Officials drive home advantage</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Officials or referee bias is most significant factor</p></li>

<li><p>Study used QuesTec data to determine officials or umpires side with the home team in pressure situations on borderline calls</p></li>

<li><p>More ambiguous the call? More likely to go in home team’s favor.</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="officials-have-confirmation-bias">Officials have confirmation bias</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Humans conform because they want to fit in and because they believe the group is better informed than they are</p></li>

<li><p>Officials aren’t really aware of the bias, it’s just a natural human response</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="s-on-home-field-advantage">?s on home field advantage</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>1) Why does home field advantage differ across sports?</p></li>

<li><p>Because refs or officials are more important or have more influence on the game. Soccer more than baseball. A penalty kick is huge, where umpire calls are fairly black and white.</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="more-s-on-home-field-advantage">More ?s on home field advantage</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>2) Why is it the same for a sport no matter where its played?</p></li>

<li><p>Because the role of the referee is the same no matter if soccer is played in America or Europe or Spain.</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="more-s-on-home-field-advantage-1">More ?s on home field advantage</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>3) Why hasn’t it changed much over time?</p></li>

<li><p>Because the officials role hasn’t changed with the rules.</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="no-i-in-team">No I in team</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>But there is an m and an e</p></li>

<li><p>There is a bigger influence of superstars in certain sports like basketball</p></li>

<li><p>Disagree with soccer, think it’s much less</p></li>

<li><p>Makes sense in basketball. Only 5 players play at a time</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="michael-jordan">Michael Jordan</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Where in baseball, a player might only get 3 at-bats a game</p></li>

<li><p>In soccer, only a few touches by your best attacker.</p></li>

<li><p>Michael Jordan - There is an I in win. So which way do you want it?</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="nfl-trades">NFL Trades</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Off the chart Mike McCoy came to own the NFL draft using a value chart that was largely designed off assumptions.</p></li>

<li><p>Tried to answer - what is the value of a draft pick in a certain round?</p></li>

<li><p>Value of the first pick in draft was 3000, and first pick in second round 580, and final pick was 0.4</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="chart-gave-value">Chart gave value</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The chart just gave the Cowboys a framework</p></li>

<li><p>It more or less stated value in multiple picks versus one high pick</p></li>

<li><p>Opposite is when the Saints traded eight draft picks for Ricky Williams. Overpaid by a ton</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="why-did-it-become-obsolete">Why did it become obsolete?</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Eventually when all teams started using the chart, it became obsolete</p></li>

<li><p>Thaler and Massey found inefficiencies</p></li>

<li><p>Teams would overpay to pick today versus playing the long game. Not comfortable with uncertainty</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="evaluating-talent">Evaluating Talent</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>It takes talent to evaluate talent.</p></li>

<li><p>Draft pick value is different for different sports. Seven rounds in NFL, just two in NBA, and 50 in MLB</p></li>

<li><p>Find value by looking at the details. Ask why</p></li>

<li><p>Brady didn’t play at Michigan more because of political reasons than his ability</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="rule-changes">Rule Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Coin toss trumps all: If you won the coin toss in overtime for NFL, you win 61 percent of time</p></li>

<li><p>This prompted changes in the NFL overtime rule. It wasn’t really fair</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="mitchell-report">Mitchell Report</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>What isn’t in the Mitchell Report Dominican players were more likely to take steroids because of cultural and situational needs</p></li>

<li><p>All incentive bias</p></li>

<li><p>The upside was far greater for Dominican players than American players. A lot of Dominicans were much younger, where American players were older and trying to get one last big contract</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="does-icing-the-kicker-or-shooter-work">Does icing the kicker or shooter work?</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>No. It’s a lukewarm strategy.</p></li>

<li><p>Study looked at NFL kicks and NBA free throws. Found no difference in performance</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="myth-of-the-hot-hand">Myth of the hot hand</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Momentum in sports doesn’t exist. We just believe it does because we like patterns</p></li>

<li><p>We don’t like mystery.</p></li>

<li><p>Randomness and luck resist explanation</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="luck">Luck</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Try flipping a coin 100 times. There will be streaks of heads or tails</p></li>

<li><p>Those streaks don’t increase the odds the next flip will land on heads.</p></li>

<li><p>We do a really poor job at understanding randomness. You aren’t due for anything. Your chances do not change because of a streak.</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="sample-sizes-and-randomness">Sample sizes and Randomness</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The true quality of teams can be measured in large sample sizes</p></li>

<li><p>Small samples are dominated by randomness</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="statistics">Statistics</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>You can make numbers say whatever you want. It’s selective. And more than one thing can be true</p></li>

<li><p>Be objective. Neutral. Look at as much data as possible to get a more accurate picture</p></li>

<li><p>Not just short-term numbers</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="cubs-cursed">Cubs cursed?</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>No, they’re not cursed or super unlucky.</p></li>

<li><p>It was deeply ingrained in the team that wins and losses didn’t matter</p></li>

<li><p>Wrigley wanted fans to enjoy the ballgame, win or lose. Lovable losers</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="cubs-curse-continued">Cubs curse continued</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Cubs could lose and attendance could go up. This wasn’t the case for almost all other teams.</p></li>

<li><p>Beer prices remained flat. Cubs fans went to game for experience, not for wins.</p></li>

<li><p>Curses aren’t to blame or Steve Bartman.</p></li>
</ul>

</section><section>

<h2 id="purpose-of-the-book">Purpose of the book</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Ignore data and diverse views as your own peril</p></li>

<li><p>Seek controversial or opposite opinions and challenge convention to improve your decision making</p></li>
</ul>
